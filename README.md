This repository contains a data analysis project focused on the College Scorecard dataset provided by the US Department of Education. The College Scorecard is a comprehensive database of metrics related to higher education institutions in the United States.

## Dataset Information

The dataset comprises several years of data, ranging from 1996-97 through 2020-21, and includes the following:

1. **Institution-level data files**: Contains aggregate data for each institution, including information on institutional characteristics, enrollment, student aid, costs, and student outcomes.
2. **Field of study-level data files**: Contains data at the credential level and 4-digit CIP code combination for each institution, including information on cumulative debt at graduation and earnings one year after graduation.
3. **Crosswalk files**: These link the Departmentâ€™s OPEID with an IPEDS UNITID for each institution.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. Calculate the average income after 10 years for students graduating from different institutions.
2. Create a comparison graph between gender, average income, and family income.
3. Analyze and recommend the best school to choose in each state based on specific criteria.
4. Add a sort function based on high/low for each type of school.
